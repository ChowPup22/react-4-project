# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to begin

## NOTE

Do NOT use personal data, this is a test project and is not secure. This is not a production ready application. This is a test project to demonstrate my skills and knowledge.

### npm i

This will install all the dependencies

### npm run serve

This will boot the server on port 3022
This would be your API endpoint through localhost:3022 to view raw data
or you can view it in the db.json file

You can change the port in the package.json file under the serve script

### npm run seed (optional)

This will seed the database with some data. This is optional as the database is already seeded. This will generate random data to populate the pages. However, I have added some test Tasks and Meetings to the database to describe some of the basic functionality of the app.

Running the script will remove all data and reseed the database with new data.
The test users are hard coded into the reseed script. You can change the number of users, tasks, and meetings that are generated by changing the number in the constants at the top of the script.

### npm start

This will boot the react app on port 3000

## Test Users

### Admin

email: admin@domain.com
password: admin@1234

This user has access to different features and is more of a team leader role than a website
developer role. They have the ability to assign tasks and meetings to other users

### Base User

email: user@domain.com
password: user@1234

This is a basic user, more of a team member role than a team leader role. They have access to
the same features as the admin user but they are not able to assign tasks to other users, and can only choose one other user to assign a meeting to. (they are assigned userId1 each time they create a meeting)

## Possible Improvements

### 1. Add an Admin Dashboard to the Admin User

This would allow the admin user to view all the users and their tasks and meetings. They would be able to assign tasks and meetings to other users and also be able to delete tasks and meetings. This would most likely utilize a filter to allow the 'team leader' to view specific users' tasks and meetings. Otherwise it would display data for all users as more of a snapshot. (i.e. Displaying only how many tasks are done over total tasks, and how many meetings are done over total meetings)

### 2. Add a User Notifications Page

This would display messages or updates sent from an admin role to a specific user role or to
all users. This would be a good way to keep users up to date on any changes or updates to the
website. This would also be a good way to send messages to users about any meetings or tasks
that they have been assigned.

### 3. Add a User Profile Page

This would allow users to view or update their profile information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
